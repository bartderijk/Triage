# Triage
In my work as a first responder at the Red Cross, I found that doing the calculations for the triage can be challenging.
Especially when there's a large number of victims, little time to spend per victim and stress levels are rising, this becomes an issue.
Accurate calculations and correcte triaging are incredibly important, there's little to no margin for error.

That's where I saw an opportunity to improve on accuracy and speed. This app takes the calculations out of the equation.
All the user (first responder) has to do, is fill in the victim's parameters and the triage class is given automatically.

The app's development is currently ongoing, but the basic functionality is working.
For more info, or getting involved in the project please reach out.

Find the app's current state at http://www.bartderijk.com/Triage/

On the todo list:
- Getting a clear triage class output in the UI (T1, T2, T3, T4)
- Adding some more pages and a navigation SPA style
- Improve visual candy
- Testing (unit & e2e)
- CI/CD
- User testing
- Promoting and getting it out there
